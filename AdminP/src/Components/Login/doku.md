# Login Component Documentation

## Overview:
This is a React functional component designed for a login form. It includes input fields for the username, password, and an optional admin key. The form handles basic user login, and provides a link to navigate to the registration page. The component accepts two props:

- `login`: A function that is triggered when the login form is submitted.
- `toRegistration`: A function that is called when the user clicks the "Registration" button.
